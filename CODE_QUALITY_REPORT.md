# Code Quality Report

## 1. Magic Numbers and Strings

### Issue
The code contains several magic numbers and strings that should be defined as constants or configuration values.

### Examples
- `3_000` milliseconds delay in `WaitForAvailableRunner`
- `10_000` milliseconds delay in `QueueMonitorWorker`
- `20_000` milliseconds timeout in `StartEphemeralContainer`
- `1` hour for container age check in `ContainerGuard`

### Recommendation
Define these as named constants at the top of the class or in a configuration file to improve readability and maintainability.

## 2. Lack of Interface Segregation

### Issue
The `IDockerService` interface is not shown but appears to be large based on the implementation. This violates the Interface Segregation Principle.

### Recommendation
Break down the interface into smaller, more specific interfaces that clients can implement selectively.

## 3. Missing Error Handling

### Issue
Some operations lack proper error handling, which could lead to silent failures.

### Examples
- In `PullImageIfNotExists`, there's no handling if `CreateImageAsync` fails
- In `StartEphemeralContainer`, container creation failures are only logged after 5 attempts

### Recommendation
Add proper error handling with appropriate logging and fallback mechanisms.

## 4. Tight Coupling

### Issue
The `DockerService` class has tight coupling with Docker.DotNet models and implementation details.

### Recommendation
Use more abstraction and dependency injection to make the service more testable and maintainable.

## 5. Inconsistent Naming

### Issue
Some method and variable names are not consistent with C# naming conventions.

### Examples
- `_emptyStruct` should be `_emptyStructValue` or similar
- `IsContainerTooOld` could be `HasContainerExpired`

### Recommendation
Follow consistent C# naming conventions throughout the codebase.

## 6. Lack of Unit Tests

### Issue
There are no unit tests visible in the codebase.

### Recommendation
Add unit tests for all public methods and critical private methods to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## 7. Hardcoded Values

### Issue
Some values are hardcoded that should be configurable.

### Examples
- Docker image name `myoung34/github-runner:latest`
- Default labels like `self-hosted`

### Recommendation
Move these to configuration where possible.

## 8. Potential Resource Leaks

### Issue
Some resources might not be properly disposed.

### Examples
- The `CancellationTokenSource` in `StartEphemeralContainer`
- Docker client connections

### Recommendation
Use `using` statements or ensure proper disposal of resources.

## 9. Complex Methods

### Issue
Some methods are too complex and do too much.

### Examples
- `StartEphemeralContainer` handles container creation, volume setup, and starting
- `ProcessWorkflow` handles multiple workflow states

### Recommendation
Break down complex methods into smaller, single-responsibility methods.

## 10. Inconsistent Logging

### Issue
Logging is inconsistent throughout the codebase.

### Recommendation
Define a consistent logging strategy and apply it throughout the codebase.

## 11. Missing XML Documentation

### Issue
Public methods lack XML documentation comments.

### Recommendation
Add XML documentation to all public members to improve code maintainability and IDE support.

## 12. Potential Race Conditions

### Issue
The `_containerGuardTask` might have race conditions.

### Recommendation
Use proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

## 13. Configuration Validation

### Issue
Configuration values are not properly validated.

### Recommendation
Add validation to ensure required configuration values are present and valid.

## 14. Missing Feature Toggles

### Issue
Some features are always enabled/disabled based on configuration.

### Recommendation
Consider using feature toggles for better control over functionality.

## 15. Inconsistent Async Patterns

### Issue
Some methods use `async`/`await` inconsistently.

### Recommendation
Follow consistent async patterns throughout the codebase.

## 16. Missing Input Validation

### Issue
Some methods don't validate their input parameters.

### Recommendation
Add proper input validation to all public methods.

## 17. Potential Security Issues

### Issue
Sensitive information is passed as environment variables.

### Recommendation
Consider using a more secure secrets management approach.

## 18. Missing Circuit Breaker

### Issue
The queue processing doesn't have a circuit breaker pattern.

### Recommendation
Implement a circuit breaker to prevent overwhelming the system during failures.

## 19. Inconsistent Cancellation

### Issue
Cancellation tokens are used inconsistently.

### Recommendation
Ensure all long-running operations properly support cancellation.

## 20. Missing Health Checks

### Issue
There are no health check endpoints.

### Recommendation
Add health check endpoints to monitor the service status.

## 21. Potential Memory Leaks

### Issue
The `_autoscalerContainersDefinition` is never cleared.

### Recommendation
Consider implementing a cleanup mechanism.

## 22. Missing Rate Limiting

### Issue
There's no rate limiting on API endpoints.

### Recommendation
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## 23. Inconsistent Configuration

### Issue
Configuration is accessed in different ways.

### Recommendation
Use a consistent configuration pattern throughout the codebase.

## 24. Missing Feature Documentation

### Issue
Some features are not documented in the README.

### Recommendation
Update the README to document all features and configuration options.

## 25. Potential Deadlocks

### Issue
The `WaitForAvailableRunner` could potentially cause deadlocks.

### Recommendation
Consider using a more sophisticated runner management approach.
